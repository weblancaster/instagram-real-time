Lollagram - Instagram Real Time App
=============

## Intro
To learn a little bit more of NodeJS, Socket.IO and for fun I developed the new version of Lollagram
consuming Instagram Real Time API.

Feel free to ask me anything and I will do my best to answer any question.

Lollagram is a labor of love that’s designed to help you keep track of the Lollapalooza experience, through the eyes (or, more accurately, snapshots) of music lovers on the ground at Grant Park. Lollagram takes advantage of the Instagram Real Time API and aggregates the moments at Lollapalooza, creating a visual record of the bands, food, people, and city that make up this great musical tradition. With 45 million photos being uploaded to Instagram each day, we're excited to present snapshots from Lollapalooza 2013.
